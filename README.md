# Global Bank- Mortage Loan Application Tracker

In this project I have created multi-page Power BI Dashbaord to help Global bank with crucial Business decisions and calculate the mortage loan application scores to decrease the response time for applications.

1. Data Loading

- Data and description for data columns has been provided by the bank in the Microsoft Excel via several worksheets.
- Loaded data using the Power BI power query.

---

2. Data Cleaning

- As per description of columns provided the bank we had to fix some abnormalities in Family status with respect to Duplicate, Redundant values. Refer Image below
  ![Replace Redundant values](<Assets/Replace Redundant Values.png>)

- Handling Outliers in Number of dependent children for eg: 30 child is impractical for an individual values that might have been errorneously entered by the human. Corrected such outliers by replcing it with appropriate values

3. Merging the Mortage Applicatio table and Down payment table to include <code>Down payment </code> column corresponding to Application number.

---

4. Add columns for deriving actual Loan Amt using the table columns itself
   <code>Loan Amt = Transction Total - Down Payment</code>

5. Mortage Applications: page shows analysis of following (clockwise)
